Significantly decrease mean time to detection (MTTD) and mean time to remediation (MTTR) via **L3 automation focus** and since $\\text{L3}\\supset(\\text{L1}\\cup\\text{L2})$, we can achieve **L1-L3 automation**\n\n3. Exceed the performance of human threat hunters especially in L3 and not just focus on automation via our proprietary models of computational creativity --> decrease MTTR \n\t- decrease in MTTR because of visualization of results and since it is fully automated, analysts only need to analyze the reasoning steps displayed\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n**Short Term Goal:**\nOur short term goal is automate threat discovery by combining the power of large language models (LLMs) with multi-scale cybersecurity event data through creative problem solving. This will be powered by our proprietary models of creativity.\n\n- Using agents (LangGraph) + DSPy (programatically tuning pretrained foundation model) \n- we utilize OCSF + BRON bidirectional, multilayer graph knowledge base of high level threat knowledge \n\n**Long Term Goal:**\nOur long term goal is to build the first post-backpropagation foundation model in cybersecurity to overcome cost and efficiency limitations of backpropagation.\n\n\nSpiral Works aims to automate the most critical parts of the SOC workflow, such as threat hunting, by developing advanced AI models that exceed human performance with capabilities such as being able to predict zero-days before threat actors discover them. Our goal is to alleviate the high cost of cybersecurity expertise, persistent SOC burnout and churn, and most importantly bias the threat landscape towards defenders. \n\nML systems currently only automate a small portion of the overall SOC workload due to their inability to correlate across complex knowledge bases and need for constant retraining. We believe this to be the root cause of the continued exacerbation of the cyber threat landscape as the gap between defenders and threat actors accelerates. Thus, our short term goal is automate threat discovery by combining the power of large language models (LLMs) with multi-scale cybersecurity event data through creative problem solving. This will be powered by our proprietary models of creativity. Our long term goal is to build the first post-backpropagation foundation model in cybersecurity to overcome cost and efficiency limitations of backpropagation. ",
