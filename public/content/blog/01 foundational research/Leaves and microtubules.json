Most people would say no, and I’d agree that trees, as we understand consciousness in humans, don’t have a self-aware experience. But I would argue that trees and other plants exhibit behaviors that suggest a model of ‘awareness’ at a basic level—an awareness centered around survival. By ‘awareness,’ I mean their ability to respond to environmental stimuli in ways that enhance their survival. For example, plants grow toward sunlight and send roots toward nutrient-rich areas underground. This adaptability, while not conscious in the human sense, shows an optimization process that parallels the survival instincts of simpler organisms like amoebas.\n\nPlants may not have thoughts, but they interact with their environment in a way that could be seen as a precursor to consciousness. Some, like the Venus flytrap, even react to touch, suggesting a basic form of sensory interfacing. This ability to sense and react is essential for survival, and in that sense, it hints at a rudimentary form of ‘awareness’—not consciousness as we experience it, but a system that interfaces with the environment to ensure survival. Why do organisms need such interfaces? The straightforward answer is that survival depends on the ability to interact with the environment, and evolution has refined these abilities over time.\n\nHowever, it seems that life on Earth, and possibly consciousness, has evolved to be deeply entangled with specific environmental conditions. The entire ecosystem is co-dependent, and this is reflected in the fact that to survive elsewhere in the universe, we need to replicate Earth-like environments. Different species have varying tolerances for environmental extremes—perhaps a cockroach could survive on Mars—but the question remains: are life and consciousness fundamentally dependent on these specific environmental conditions?\n\nLife certainly needs certain basic environmental factors—heat, light, food, water, oxygen. And consciousness, at least as we understand it, seems to be a sophisticated tool that helps organisms ensure these conditions are met. In the case of trees, photosynthesis could be seen as one of the primary functions their biological ‘awareness’ supports. Let’s assume for a moment that photosynthesis is all a tree ‘does’ in this context. Now if we model the whole process of a leaf deriving ATP from the photons of sunlight and glucose water absorbed through the roots, we could say that we modeled what a tree 'awareness' does, but it wouldn’t capture the full essence of being a tree. Each tree adapts differently to its environment—based on genetics, climate, and access to resources—and this adaptation is crucial to its survival.\n\nSimilarly, if we have a model of what consciousness does to maximize survival in humans based on the macro-scale entanglements in the microtubules of our neurons, we’d have a description of what consciousness does but not the consciousness itself. It’s like having F=ma to describe motion: you can predict a ball’s trajectory, but you don’t have the ball itself. The challenge lies in understanding how to move from a model of what consciousness does to the actual creation of a novel consciousness.\n\nLife follows principles similar to automata theory, where simple rules can lead to remarkable complexity. Evolution shows that with relatively simple genetic rules, highly complex organisms can emerge. But evolution hasn’t just produced complexity; it has also produced organisms that have increasingly sophisticated ways of interfacing with the world, which might be the key to understanding consciousness. Perhaps, if we understood the principles underlying how evolution gives rise to complex life forms, we could generate beings with rich sensory experiences—potentially with an even deeper or broader capacity for conscious awareness than we have.\n\nIn that sense, the richness of conscious experience—or qualia—could depend on the complexity and sensitivity of this interfacing with the environment. The more sophisticated the sensory interface, the richer the potential for conscious experience.\n\n**Penrose and Hammaroff’s theory of consciousness: Orch-OR**\n\nAccording to Penrose, awareness must precede understanding. And understanding must precede creativity. This goes back to his argument from The Emperor’s New Mind where he states that humans have the ability to intuitively understand a fact to be true despite logically (according to rules) something is unprovable. His argument is that we are able to transcend rules because of understanding. Transcending rules is a feature of understanding.  \n\nSome of my other conclusions:  \n  \n“rough map: creativity <-- understanding <-- awareness. e.g., a crow comes up with a creative solution to drink water by dropping pebbles in a half full jar. so by being _aware_ of the water physics (through observation or genetically) and using its _understanding_ accordingly it comes up with a _creative solution_. so like Steve Jobs, the crow is also doing some _reality distortion_ in a primitive sense. more complex creativity like art would require higher level of awareness, which would include qualia. so we can certainly start with that primitive awareness and LLM's creative abilities indicate that it is capable of those basic awareness (contextual attention.) basically, low level consciousness - awareness (binary view of the world. threat? if yes, run away. mate? if yes, run towards) high level consciousness - sentience (phenomenal consciousness/qualia) dont wanna do just RL (analogous to awareness based reflexes) like most sota LLM algos (self-reflection and other finetuning algos) but it'll probs be sufficient for the mvp. my intuition is we need to implement higher dimensional awareness to achieve richer creativity”\n\n  \n\n“Addressing the modality definition, it is def general enough for the current framework of creativity. for the framework i got for artificial/simulated awareness just gotta make the modality tie back into fitness optimization bc the primary purpose of living beings' sensory info is to optimize survival. so analogous to millions of biological sensory receptors monitoring whole the system, this would be analogous to giving low lvl os, hardware etc. system resources info included in the modality. the purpose of modality here is not only to help with user inputs (limited in a conversation,) but a continual internal awareness”\n\n  \n\nBased on all the above conclusions, a rough version of the modality definition for the mathematical definition of artificial/simulated awareness that ties back to the theory of creativity\n# Expanded Definition of Modality and Modality Mapping Functions\n\n## 1. Modality Definition\n\nA modality M ∈ 𝓜 is defined as a tuple:\n\nM := (S, E, T, Ω, φ, F)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S = {s₁, s₂, s₃, ..., sₙ} is a set of sensory or data channels, where each sᵢ represents a distinct channel (e.g., visual, auditory, textual, numerical, system resources).\n\n- E = {e₁, e₂, e₃, ..., eₘ} is a set of elementary units or primitives for each channel in S. E.g., pixels for visual, phonemes for auditory, characters for textual, etc.\n\n- T: S × E → ℝᵈ is a transformation function mapping elements from a sensory channel to a d-dim. real-valued representation, allowing for continuous/discrete representations.\n\n- Ω: (𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ → (S × E)* is an encoding function mapping the conceptual reasoning space to sequences of elementary units across sensory channels. * denotes the Kleene star operations.\n\n- φ: (S × E)* → 𝒫((𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ) is a decoding function that maps from sequences of elementary units to a probability distribution over possible concept-reasoning paths.\n\n- F: (𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ → ℝ is a fitness function that evaluates the survival value or utility of a given concept-reasoning path in the context of the system's goals or environment.\n\n## 2. Modality Mapping Functions\n\nLet 𝓜 be the space of all possible modalities. We define a surjective mapping function F_M and its inverse set-valued function F_M⁻¹ as follows:\n\nF_M: (𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ → 𝓜\n\nF_M⁻¹: 𝓜 → 𝒫((𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ)\n\nWhere 𝓒 is the concept space, ℛ is the reasoning space, n is the length of the conceptual and reasoning paths, and 𝒫 denotes the power set.\n\nExtending these definitions to align with the modality tuple structure:\n\nF_M(c,r) = T(Ω(c,r)) for (c,r) ∈ (𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ\n\nF_M⁻¹(m) = support(φ(T⁻¹(m))) for m ∈ 𝓜\n\nWhere:\n- support() denotes the support of the probability distribution\n- T⁻¹ is the inverse transformation function (which may be an approximation if T is not perfectly invertible)\n\n## 3. Integration of Definitions\n\nThe modality mapping functions F_M and F_M^(-1) provide a bridge between the conceptual-reasoning space (C x R)^n and the modality space M. They can be understood in terms of the components of the modality tuple:\n\n1. F_M uses the encoding function Ω to map from the conceptual-reasoning space to sequences of elementary units, then applies the transformation T to convert these into the modality's representation.\n\n2. F_M^(-1) first inverts the transformation T, then uses the decoding function φ to map back to the conceptual-reasoning space, taking the support of the resulting probability distribution to get the set of possible conceptual-reasoning paths.\n\nThe fitness function F can be applied to the output of F_M^(-1) to evaluate the utility or survival value of the possible conceptual-reasoning paths associated with a given modality state.\n\nThis integrated definition provides a comprehensive framework for modeling the relationship between abstract conceptual-reasoning processes and concrete sensory-motor modalities, while also incorporating the notion of fitness or utility. It allows for bidirectional mapping between these spaces, supporting both the generation of modality states from abstract concepts and reasoning, and the interpretation of sensory inputs in terms of higher-level concepts and reasoning paths.\n\n# Potential ways to integrate this definition of modality with the original theory of creativity\n\n## 1. Idea Representation\n\nIn the creativity framework:\nI := ((C₁, ..., Cₙ), (R₁, ..., Rₙ₋₁)) ∈ 𝓒ⁿ × ℛⁿ⁻¹\n\nConnection to modality:\n- The modality mapping function F_M: (𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ → 𝓜 can transform an idea I into its modality representation.\n- F_M⁻¹: 𝓜 → 𝒫((𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ) can map a modality state back to possible ideas.\n\nThis allows ideas to be expressed and manipulated in various sensory/motor modalities, enriching the creative process.\n\n## 2. Domain Knowledge\n\nFramework definition: G_D := (C_D, R_D, φ_D) for a scientific discipline D\n\nIntegration with modality:\n1. Represent C_D and R_D using the sensory channels S and elementary units E in our modality definition.\n2. Use the transformation function T: S × E → ℝᵈ to convert domain knowledge into a standardized representation.\n3. Employ Ω: (𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ → (S × E)* and φ: (S × E)* → 𝒫((𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ) to map between domain concepts and their sensory representations.\n\nThis allows for a multi-modal representation of domain knowledge, potentially uncovering non-obvious connections.\n\n## 3. Creativity Criteria\n\n### 3.1 D-Surprise\n\nFramework definition: S(I; D) := 1/n Σⱼ₌₁ⁿ D_D(Cⱼ, Cⱼ₊₁)\n\nModality integration:\n- Use the modality representation to calculate semantic dissimilarity: \n  D_D(Cⱼ, Cⱼ₊₁) = d(F_𝓜(Cⱼ), F_M(Cⱼ₊₁))\n  where d is a distance function in the modality space 𝓜.\n\nThis allows surprise to be measured across different sensory modalities.\n\n### 3.2 D-Novelty\n\nFramework definition: N(I; D) = 1[∄(R₁, ..., Rₙ₋₁) ∈ ℛⁿ⁻¹ s.t. φ_D(Rᵢ) = {Cᵢ, Cᵢ₊₁}, ∀i ∈ [n-1]]\n\nModality integration:\n- Evaluate novelty in the modality space:\n  N(I; D) = 1[∄m ∈ 𝓜 s.t. F_𝓜⁻¹(m) contains (R₁, ..., Rₙ₋₁)]\n\nThis allows for detecting novel connections that might not be apparent in the abstract concept space.\n\n### 3.3 D-Utility\n\nFramework definition: U(I; P; S) = S(P) ∈ {0, 1}\n\nModality integration:\n- Use the fitness function F: (𝓒 × ℛ)ⁿ → ℝ from our modality definition:\n  U(I; P; S) = σ(F(I))\n  where σ is a function that maps ℝ to {0, 1}.\n\nThis provides a concrete way to evaluate the utility of ideas based on their fitness in the modality space.\n\n## 4. Creativity Calculation\n\nFramework definition: C(I; D; P) = U(I; P; S) · S(I; D) · N(I; D)\n\nModality-enhanced calculation:\nC(I; D; P) = σ(F(I)) · (1/n Σⱼ₌₁ⁿ d(F_M(Cⱼ), F_M(Cⱼ₊₁))) · 1[∄m ∈ 𝓜 s.t. F_𝓜⁻¹(m) contains (R₁, ..., Rₙ₋₁)]\n\nThis integrated formula calculates creativity by considering utility, surprise, and novelty in the modality space 𝓜.\n\n## 5. Multi-modal Creativity\n\nWhile not explicitly in the original framework, our modality definition enables:\n1. Cross-modal creative ideas: Inspire connections between different sensory channels S.\n2. Multi-modal evaluation: Assess creativity across various modalities simultaneously.\n3. Sensorimotor creativity: Incorporate both sensory inputs and motor outputs in the creative process.\n\nExample: C_multi(I; D; P) = Σₖ wₖ · C(F_M(I); D; P)\nwhere F_Mₖ represents the mapping to the k-th modality, and wₖ are weights.\n\nThis multi-modal approach allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of creativity that aligns with theories of embodied cognition.\n",
