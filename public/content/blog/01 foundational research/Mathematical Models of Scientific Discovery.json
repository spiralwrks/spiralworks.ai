Hypothesis generation \n2. Validate plausibility of hypothesis\n3. Confirm or refute hypothesis\n4. *Integrate new discovery into existing knowledge structure*\n\nWe append *new knowledge integration* as a fourth step. We emphasize, in a Piagetian sense, the importance of striking \"an equilibrium between the assimilation of the contents into the frameworks and the differentiating accomodation of the frameworks to the contents\" when modifying knowledge structures computationally. We can further understand that:\n\n(2) is ensuring the structure of the hypothesis is consistent with the axioms of logic, and \n\n(3) is ensuring the content of the hypothesis is consistent with the set of facts, truths, theorems, laws, etc. belonging to the discipline(s) in which the hypothesis was made.\n\n## Our Overarching Sentiment\nWe are in the age of foundation models: gigantic architectures with multi-modal representations from training corpora spanning nearly the entire internet. Meanwhile, scientific and creative discovery is foundationally the transformation and permutation of existing concepts and ideas. Our overarching sentiment is that:\n> Mainstream multi-modal foundation models (Claude, ChatGPT, Llama, etc.) contain all the requisite concepts and ideas for theoretical knowledge discovery, and, as such, empower the creative discovery process through strategic prompting and use.\n\nAt various stages in our system design, we treat foundation models as mere repositories of representations that can be accessed conversationally, exactly analgous to relational databases than can be accessed through structured query languages.\n\n## A Computational Definition of Creativity\n\n> Creativity is the novel, useful, and surprising combination of learned representations of sensorimotor data, joined by chains of thought with eclectic semantic links but in familiar meta-cognitive landscapes.\n\n\n# 1. Hypothesis Generation\n\n## Bisociative Creativity\nIn *Koestler (1964)*, bisociation is defined as \n>  the perceiving of a situation or concept in two self-consistent but habitually incompatible frames of reference.\n\nGroundbreaking discoveries, such as the theory of relativity, laws of planetary motion, and the invention of the printing press, can be framed as bisociations between concepts. Visually, we can understand bisociation in the following way:\n\n![Screenshot 2024-06-23 at 6 53 18 PM](assets/Pasted image 20240729181732.png)\n\nThe yellow circle $S$ represents the initial starting point of the problem, located in the context $M_1$, which is visually represented as a plane, although we do not intend for this geometric interpretation to be anything but a helpful visual. The blue plane $M_2$ represents a context that, when combined with $M_1$, yields a solution through a semantic link $L$.\n\n### Implementation of Bisociative Creativity\nIn the context of cybersecurity anomaly detection, we aim to \"brainstorm\" logically plausible connections between pairs of concepts in a layered graph, representing the knowledge of the cybersecurity domain. In this example the concept pairs are *technique* and *attack style*.\n![Screenshot 2024-06-23 at 6 58 44 PM](assets/Pasted image 20240729181732.png)\n\nThe semantic link between contexts ($L$ in the previous graphic) is denoted here with the red line, which is implemented using Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning with an LLM. The LLM COT reasoning that links between technique and attack styles is then verified so that it is self-consistent and, further, logically consistent with the set of truths, facts, laws, etc. in the cybersecurity domain. \n\n### General Associative Creativity\nWe also define a general form of associative creativity for a layered knowledge graph. Given $N$ conceptual plains, we aim to brainstorm of a chain of pairwise bisociations to form a logically plausible chain of creative reasoning. We assume each conceptual plane has $\\le k \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ concepts, so that there are no more than $kN$ idea pairs. \n![Screenshot 2024-06-23 at 7 05 15 PM](assets/Pasted image 20240729181732.png)\n\n# 2. Hypothesis Logical Validation\n\n# 3. Hypothesis Confirmation or Refutation\nHypotheses can be confirmed or refuted on the basis of their agreement or disagreement with the fundamental truths, facts, laws, etc. of the discipline(s) in which they were made. Additionally, hypotheses can be evaluated by their **non-obviousness**, one of the creativity criteria, in the form of their forward flow.\n(TODO: add context and definition of forward flow)\n\n# 4.
