Here’s how these approaches aim to solve the challenges in threat hunting and automation in security operations:\n\n### 1. BRON: Bridging Threat and Vulnerability Data\n- **Concept:** BRON (Bridge of Relations and Objects in Networks) is a graph database amalgamating key public threat and vulnerability information sources like MITRE’s ATT&CK MATRIX, CAPEC, CWE, and CVE.\n- **Functionality:** BRON links threat tactics, techniques, and patterns with defensive weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and affected platform configurations. This relational data structure enhances the context and visibility of threat landscapes.\n- **Application:** Enables bi-directional, relational path tracing to identify attack patterns, techniques, and tactics linked to specific vulnerabilities, providing comprehensive insights for threat hunting and security operations.\n\n### 2. Enhancing Machine Learning with BRON\n- **Machine Learning Integration:** BRON supports the application of ML for predicting related threat techniques and attack patterns by utilizing behavioral knowledge from collated datasets.\n- **Pattern Inference:** Uses graph properties and natural language processing to predict links between ATT&CK Techniques and CAPEC nodes, which aids in identifying missing or unreported connections in the dataset.\n- **Results:** Demonstrates improved performance in predicting Technique-CAPEC links using various classification methods, indicating that more data and better feature representations can enhance ML models for cybersecurity applications.\n\n### 3. Enhancements for Cyber Analytics, Hunting, and Simulations\n- **Bidirectional Relational Knowledge:** Enhances sources by transposing unidirectional links to create bidirectional relational knowledge, facilitating more convenient hypothesis-driven cyber hunting.\n- **Gap Filling:** Uses machine learning to infer missing links in relational knowledge, verified by experts to find novel and plausible relationships.\n- **Red Team Planning:** Supports red team exercises by preparing information for attack simulations, leveraging BRON to map attack patterns and vulnerabilities, and facilitating the creation of detailed attack model trees.\n- **Network Defense Postures:** Utilizes BRON to support modeling and simulation frameworks for network defense postures, allowing investigation into how different ML algorithms find various defensive postures.\n\n#### Detailed Enhancements:\n- **Transposing Unidirectional Links:** By creating bidirectional relational knowledge, BRON enhances the sources used for cyber analytics and hunting, making it easier to trace and understand connections between threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations.\n- **Machine Learning for Link Inference:** Machine learning techniques, including natural language processing and supervised learning, are used to infer new, plausible links between entries in the knowledge base. These inferred links are then validated by experts to ensure their accuracy and relevance.\n- **Red Team Exercise Preparation:** BRON's detailed mapping of attack patterns, techniques, and vulnerabilities supports red team planning by providing comprehensive information for simulating attacks and assessing network defenses.\n- **Modeling and Simulation:** BRON is used to model defensive postures in a simulated environment, allowing the investigation of different machine learning algorithms' effectiveness in identifying and countering cyber threats.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy integrating BRON into cybersecurity operations, these approaches aim to enhance threat hunting capabilities through improved data visibility, predictive modeling, and automation. The relational graph database structure of BRON provides a comprehensive view of the threat landscape, linking abstract tactics and techniques with concrete vulnerabilities and affected configurations. This enables more effective threat detection, prediction, and response, addressing challenges like sparse data sources and high false positive rates that traditional ML solutions struggle with.\n\n",
