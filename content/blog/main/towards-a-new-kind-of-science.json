To the early, ancient Greeks, however, this was a normal explanation that stood unchallenged. Pre-scientific myth-makers would attribute natural phenomena to what we now understand to be “supernatural,” or mythical, causes - seastorms to Poseidon, healing to Apollo, thunderstorms to Zeus. We speak of early Greek “philosophy” rather than “science” for precisely this reason. All inquiry was originally speculatory, and it was not subject to rigorous scrutiny. \n\nThe birth of science is often traced to the pre-Socratic philosophers Thales and Xenophanes and their innovative doctrine of a critical attitude toward myth - a willingness to ask whether thunder was the act of a god, or if simpler, natural explanations could suffice. These thinkers, likewise, presented their beliefs as conjectoral and open to criticism, rather than dogmatic and rigid, fostering a more open dialogue between master and pupil. With them, scientific practice became distinguished from pseudo-scientific speculation through the notion of critical rationalism: the idea that explanations and ideas are hypotheses whose veracity remain “to be established” rather than immediate and immutable truths. This doctrine of bold conjecture and critical scrutiny remains the cornerstone of modern science. At Spiral Works, it is an attitude we take deeply to heart.\n\n## What is Science?\n\nToday, new challenges and possibilities confront us. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to augment and accelerate the scientific process represents one of the most profound innovations in our species’ history. As Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, notes of [biological discovery](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace), the “rate of discovery could be increased by 10x or more if there were a lot more talented, creative researchers.” He continues to say “it is by speeding up the whole research process that AI can truly accelerate biology.” We believe this principle holds more broadly - across all scientific disciplines. Spiral Works’ mission, therefore, combines these two insights into a singular motto: towards creative superintelligence. \n\nAs this revolution unfolds, it is increasingly important to disambiguate science from other branches of inquiry. We adopt the tripartite, Popperian distinction from [Conjectures and Refutations](https://www.amazon.com/Conjectures-Refutations-Scientific-Knowledge-Routledge/dp/0415285941):\n1. Logic and mathematics\n2. Empirical and natural science\n3. Metaphysics and philosophy\n\nEach is distinguished by its method of verification, or lack thereof. The method of verification in logic and mathematics is formal proof - a logico-mathematical statement is either true or false. Conversely, empirical and natural science are hallmarked by the [doctrine of falsification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability), for we can never know an empirical statement to be definitively true. A scientific theory, likewise, is never “proved true,” but only becomes more corroborated by evidence the better it resists attempts at falsification. Our goal as scientists is to design rigorous experiments whose outcomes can best corroborate or falsify our hypotheses, without falling into traps like those articulated by the [Duhem-Quine thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis) - where, from the outcome of a falsifying experiment, we are unsure which of our hypothesis or its background assumptions was false. \n\nMetaphysics and philosophy, we like to say, pick up where science and mathematics leave off. What is worth asking, and how do we tell when we understand it? Philosophical inquiry done right is invaluable, but as Popper notes, “genuine philosophical problems are always rooted in urgent problems outside philosophy, and they die if these roots decay.” We must be careful not to let our heads get caught in the clouds for too long, as is sometimes common among philosophers. We must be rationalists and empiricists, theorists and practitioners - for it is the interplay between these approaches that leads to the most holistic understanding. As Hadamard notes in The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field:\n\n“Application is useful and eventually essential to theory by the very fact that it opens new questions for the latter. One could say that application’s constant relation to theory is the same as that of the leaf to the tree: one supports the other, but the former feeds the latter.” (p. 125)\n\n\n## The Structure of Science\n\nWith this in mind, how does scientific knowledge actually grow? It is tempting to think of science as a steady accumulation of facts, brick upon brick, until the edifice of knowledge is built. Yet history reveals something more radical: old frameworks are overturned, sometimes violently, and become replaced by new ones. \n\nIt was Kuhn’s landmark 1962 text, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which provided the most compelling argument for this now widely-adopted position, dispelling the “development-by-accumulation” doctrine in favor of his paradigmatic view. According to Kuhn, periods of normal science, consisting of problem solving within a fixed conceptual space (or “paradigm”), are followed by spurts of extraordinary science, when anomalies prompt scientists to recourse to philosophy, return to first principles, and debate over fundamentals. The result is ultimately a scientific revolution that alters previous worldviews and establishes a new paradigm. The term “paradigm shift,” unsurprisingly, was born here. In our Transformational Creativity in Science paper, we provided a mathematical model for this type of creativity, arguing that identifying and modifying the axioms of a conceptual space has the most creative potential. Though Kuhn’s insights always remained qualitative, not quantitative, perhaps due to his belief that successive paradigms were incommensurable and could not be compared one-to-one, newer generations of scholars such as ourselves saw beyond this limitation. \n\nSimilarly, Paul Thagard’s Conceptual Revolutions proposed a quantitative criterion - explanatory coherence - to evaluate competing theories over the same body of evidence, offering a mathematical model that could explain why previous revolutions occurred - why the oxygen theory was more coherent than the phlogiston theory, or why heliocentric astronomy was a better system than the prevailing geocentric model. \n\nToday, foundational, philosophical work is often overlooked by scientists studying AI for scientific discovery. Most of these thinkers hail from overwhelmingly quantitative backgrounds, preferring not to venture too far beyond the world of mathematics. We argue this is a critical mistake - building scientifically creative AI without a deep understanding of the words “science” and “creativity” is a recipe for disaster. Disciplinary silos, the publish-or-perish mentality, and the novelty bias in AI research today have incentivized shallow work that games citation and publication counts without meaningfully advancing the field. Philosophically rigorous work has become the outlier, rather than the norm. \n\nNevertheless, as scientists (rather, great scientists, as we should all aspire to be), we must recognize when our thinking has become overly confined to existing mathematical, computational, or scientific toolkits - when the existing paradigms fail to address the range of phenomena we wish to explain. In other words, when the rules of normal science no longer suffice. The ability to do this is extremely rare. Very few thinkers, research groups, or institutions are dexterous enough to tow the line between mathematics, science, and philosophy without getting lost somewhere in between. The program Modern Paradigms in Generalization at the Simons Institute, Berkeley was an exception in this regard, bringing together leading minds across disciplines, academia, and industry to re-think the fundamentals of intelligence. I was fortunate to lead an interdisciplinary seminar studying creativity and the science of intelligence during my time there.\n\nSpiral Works too is committed to a scientific practice that works hand-in-hand with philosophy. In the words of Popper, “we are not students of some subject matter but students of problems… and problems may cut right across the border of any subject matter or discipline.” This has worked well for us so far, and for reasons that should by now be clear, this has historically been most fruitful. As Alex Karp notes in The Technological Republic, this was actually the norm before science became specialized:\n\nThe innovators of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were often polymaths whose interests diverged wildly from the contemporary expectation that depth, as opposed to breadth, is the most effective means of contributing to a field. The term “scientist” itself was only coined in 1834, to describe Mary Somerville, a Scottish astronomer and mathematician; prior to that, the blending of pursuits across physics and the humanities, for instance, was so commonplace and natural that a more specialized word had not been needed. Many had little regard for the boundary lines between disciplines, ranging from areas of study as seemingly unrelated as linguistics to chemistry, and zoology to physics.\n\nAt Spiral Works, we do not blindly inquire, but instead, before the pencil ever hits the paper, ask ourselves “What scientific problems are most worth solving?” Today, the riddle of science itself stands at the top of our list. How can we develop mathematical language and conceptual toolkits to understand creativity, discovery, and invention? Problems like these form the foundation of our research agenda, but the questions do not stop here. How do we build robust, computational systems that exhibit these abilities too? This is a tall mountain to climb, but we are no stranger to challenges.\n\n## Towards a Logic of Discovery and Creativity\n\nOver the next few years, we are committed to solving two riddles which have, from time immemorial, perplexed even the most brilliant thinkers in science and philosophy: (1) is there a logic of scientific discovery, and (2) can creativity be mathematically modeled?\n\nUpon first glance, it seems philosophers of science have wrestled with the first question for a long time, but these efforts have been deceiving. Attempts at articulating a logic of discovery have often detailed rules for justification in disguise. Perhaps this shouldn’t surprise us. It is a far more straightforward task to falsify or corroborate an idea once we have it - philosophers of science have naturally fixated on the logic of justification rather than the logic of discovery, relegating the latter to the cognitive sciences and psychology.\n\nThe logic of justification indeed comes with its own set of challenges - such as Hume’s (old) problem of induction, which questions the logical basis from which we can perform inference on observed phenomena to gain knowledge about unobserved phenomena, or Goodman’s new problem of induction, which wrestles with the problem of determining which predicates are projectible during inductive inference. For the sake of brevity, we will not go into further detail on this topic here.\n\nPerhaps no thinker has spent more time attempting to understand human creativity, our second riddle, than Dean Keith Simonton. In Creativity in Science, Simonton argues creativity can be understood in terms of four key factors. First, “logic” refers to the argument that creativity follows from logical deduction to fit empirical facts. “Genius” then argues that some people are gifted, endowed with unique traits and abilities that predispose them towards monumental discoveries and inventions. “Chance” maintains that creativity is an inherently probabilistic process, and that all discovery is serendipitous to a degree. Finally, “zeitgeist” argues from the phenomenon of scientific multiples, where a handful of great inventions were made by two or more people independently at nearly the same time, that “the times determine what can and cannot be conceived.”\n\nThere is some truth to all these perspectives. Any mathematical model of the creative process will clearly delineate some logical structure to which most inventions conform - Boden’s three types of creativity (combinatorial, exploratory, and transformational) and Simonton’s table of creativity mechanisms already provide a high-level distinction here.\n\nAt the same time, psychologists have long known that success in creative domains is correlated with certain traits and cognitive abilities - high IQ, associative richness, openness to experience, and Janusian thinking, to name a few. Creatives are also well aware of the fact that discovery is inherently probabilistic - sometimes we go barking up the wrong tree, wasting time on problems that are not yet “ripe for discovery,” as Arthur Koestler, author of The Act of Creation and the first to illustrate the role combinatorial creativity has played in historical discoveries, puts it. Chance and zeitgeist do indeed play a role.\n\nSkeptics may now feel that this applies to our two riddles: (1) is there a logic of scientific discovery, and (2) can creativity be mathematically modeled? At Spiral Works, we firmly believe the time is now. These themes are indeed “ripe for discovery.” Even beyond this, the broader implications are too important to ignore: a deep understanding of scientific discovery and creativity can address many of the challenges we are currently facing in AI research.\n\n## A New Kind of Science\n\n“We believe it is fair to characterise Computational Creativity as a frontier for AI research beyond all others - maybe, even, the final frontier.” (Colton and Wiggins, 2012)\n\nPapers and patents are becoming less disruptive. Radically novel work has become discouraged. Something has gone wrong in the evolution of science, but AI is poised to change that.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) now offer a practical substrate for open-ended, AI-driven discovery. Early studies have found that LLMs can generate more novel ideas than human scientists. Of course, this does not mean AI systems are the end-all-be-all solution that techno-optimists often tout them to be. Countless problems have surfaced so far: AI-generated ideas tend to plagiarize, make unrealistic assumptions, be vague on implementation details, use inappropriate baselines or omit them entirely, overuse resources, and more. When it comes to execution of research ideas, human ideas tend to perform better, in what has been named the ideation-execution gap. \n\nRobust deployment of these systems will require continued research into the fundamental nature of creativity and scientific discovery. As we emphasized earlier, building scientifically creative AI without a deep understanding of the words “science” and “creativity” is a recipe for disaster. This is precisely our mission at Spiral Works - building the theoretical foundations and practical systems that take us towards creative superintelligence. We could not be more excited about what the next one to two years look like in this space.\n\n",
