  "content": "Spiral Works is an **early stage moonshot research lab** with the aim to build the first scientific discovery foundry within the **next 10 years**.\n \nThis foundry will be an interconnected network of AI scientists working in parallel across many domains, continuously synthesizing insights from a growing body of scientific literature. Each AI scientist not only generates, tests, and validates its own breakthroughs, but also draws upon the discoveries and insights of others in the network - creating a powerful feedback loop where cross-domain inspiration catalyzes even greater scientific breakthroughs.\n## Our Core Hypotheses\n\nOur work towards our moonshot vision is guided by four hypotheses we aim to tackle **sequentially**:\n\nFirst, we believe in taking a **structured** approach to building AI. Rather than focusing solely on scaling up existing models or paradigms, we need to develop an overarching **formal theory of intelligence** incorporating the following (but not limited to):\n- inference mechanisms\n- intuitions\n- intuitions about representations\n- intuitions about reason\n- reason \n- curiosity\n- understanding\n- creativity\n\nSecond, we believe science itself follows patterns we can understand and enhance. **Scientific progress is not random** - it moves like a **spiral** (Gallais's evolutionary spiral) [1]. \n\n![gallais-evolutionary-spiral.png](/content/blog/assets/gallais-evolutionary-spiral.png)\n\nThis allows for the formal systematization of the very evolution of science itself and consequently a rigorous, structured approach to the **automation of science** using our **first hypothesis**. We believe then that AI scientists can understand and work with the **natural rhythm** of science and ultimately **accelerate** \"normal science\" [2] to gain much faster rates of **breakthrough science**.\n\nThird, we believe the key to advancing AI lies not in specific model architectures, but in creating **truly recursive** systems that can examine and improve themselves. While many AI companies focus on proprietary architectures as their competitive advantage, we see this as fundamentally limiting. Instead, we are pursuing AI systems that can look inside their own structure, regardless of how they are built, and optimize themselves through a process of genuine **self-reflection**. We aim to go beyond the paradigm of adjusting weights or hyperparameters and move towards a system that can fundamentally **understand and modify its own architecture**.\n\nWe believe this approach transcends the current \"static\" focus on specific model architectures or training techniques. The true technical moat isn't in the model architecture but in the **system's capability for recursive self-improvement and adaptation**. Whether a system starts as a transformer, a recurrent network, or something entirely different becomes less important than its ability to understand and modify itself. \n\nFourth, we believe that by combining our theoretical understanding of intelligence, our grasp of scientific progress patterns, and our recursive AI systems, we can pioneer a new kind of **scientific ecosystem** - what we call a scientific discovery foundry. We go beyond building individual AI scientists and aim to create an **interconnected network** of AI scientists that can work together in ways that transcend human limitations.\n\nIn this foundry, AI scientists will operate across multiple levels simultaneously:\n- At the individual level, each AI scientist will conduct research using its recursive capabilities to improve its own understanding and methods\n- At the team level, AI scientists will collaborate, sharing insights and building on each other's discoveries\n- At the network level, the system will identify patterns and connections across different fields that might be invisible to human researchers\n\nThis networked approach creates powerful feedback loops:\n- Discoveries in one field can immediately inform research in others\n- Successful research strategies can be quickly shared and adapted across the network\n- Cross-domain insights can emerge naturally from the continuous synthesis of knowledge\n\nWe believe this foundry approach will not only accelerate scientific progress but fundamentally transform how science is done. Instead of isolated breakthroughs happening in siloed labs, we will see a continuous flow of discoveries emerging from the collective intelligence of interconnected AI scientists.\n\nThis is how we move beyond the current paradigm where AI assists human scientists, to one where AI systems actively drive scientific discovery while working alongside humans, creating a symbiotic relationship that maximizes the strengths of both human and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Our Current Progress\nOur journey toward building a scientific discovery foundry begins with tackling our first hypothesis in developing an overarching formal theory of intelligence. Towards that end, we conducted fundamental research into gaining a theoretical understanding of **creativity**, one of the essential elements of human cognition/intelligence.\n\nWe developed a formal, mathematical framework to measure scientific creativity and applied it in understanding and improving creativity in language models. We are currently focused on the first step in scientific discovery, **generating and evaluating novel scientific ideas**. To that end, we have come up with the **first optimization algorithms** with **provable guarantees** for **measurably** enhancing the novelty, utility, and feasibility of a generated idea. \n\nUsing this as our foundation, we aim to massively scale our experiments to the **commercialization** of scientific and industrial **creative knowledge discovery** via what we dub as the development of a **eureka engine**. \n\nWe believe the concept of a eureka engine would greatly accelerate the rate at which we unlock the **economic and social value** of the networked data and services our society creates. \n\n\n## Closing Remarks\nWe are pursuing this mission as a small, independent research lab, bringing together experts in AI, mathematics, and many more domains to do radical science. Our focus is on building transparent systems with provable guarantees that advances science and ultimately beneficial to humanity.\n\nIf you are excited about our vision, we would love to hear from you:\n- royce@spiralworks.ai\n- follow us on X at [@spiralworks_ai](https://x.com/spiralworks_ai)\n\n\n## References\n\n1.
